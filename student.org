** Experiment 1 : Comparison between native and docker execution

Note : Docker is a software for "light" virtualization. More information : https://www.docker.com/what-docker

For all the following experiments, Docker is used with a standard Debian image.

In this experiments, the experimentation script have been modified to make 50 tests for every size. The computer was not used while the experiments.

Command to launch Docker (the -ti options launch an interactive shell, the -v option mounts a local directory inside the VM):
#+begin_src
docker -ti -v $(SRC_PATH) debian
#+end_src

Once the docker VM launched, the executable is recompiled with make.
The results, separated by execution mode (Built-in, Sequential and Parallel), are the following.
Note : The data are in a CSV file with 4 field : Time, Size, Type and Method.
Data recuperation :
#+begin_src
mix <- read.csv("mix.csv")
sum_mix = ddply(mix, c("Size", "Type", "Method"), summarize,
				num = length(Time), mean = mean(Time), sd = sd(Time),
				se = 2*sd/sqrt(num))
d_mix = ddply(mix, c("Size", "Type", "Method"))
#+end_src

A quick data summary (sum_mix) :

For the native execution :
#+begin_src
ggplot(data = d_native, aes(x=Size, y=Time, color=factor(Type))) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + facet_wrap(~Type)
#+end_src

For the Docker execution :
#+begin_src
ggplot(data = d_docker, aes(x=Size, y=Time, color=factor(Type))) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + facet_wrap(~Type)
#+end_src

[[file:cr/docker_separated.png]]

Comparison :
#+begin_src
ggplot(data = d_mix, aes(x=Size, y=Time, color=factor(Type))) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + facet_wrap(~Type)
#+end_src

Let's try to make a linear model to see which execution is the fastest !
#+begin_src
ggplot(data = d_mix, aes(x=Size, y=Time, color=factor(Method))) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + facet_wrap(~Type) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
#+end_src
[[file:cr/mix_lm_log10.png]]

The linear model looks weird with a log10 scale, let's remove it.
#+begin_src
ggplot(data = d_mix, aes(x=Size, y=Time, color=factor(Method))) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Type) + geom_smooth(method="lm")
#+end_src
