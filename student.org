## Experiment 1 : Comparaison between native and docker execution

Note : Docker is a software for "light" virtualization. [More information](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)
For all the following experiments, Docker is used with a standard Debian image.

In this experiments, the experimentation script have been modified to make 50 tests for every size. The computer was not used while the experiments. The results, separated by execution mode (Built-in, Sequential and Parallel), are the following.

For the native execution :

For the Docker execution :

Comparison :

The comparison shows that the Docker execution may be as fast as the native execution in Built-in mode, but is slower for the other modes. To check this hypothesis, we need to look at the confidence interval.

TODO

Let's try to make a linear model !

In the parallel execution in Docker, two points seem to be very far from the linear model.
